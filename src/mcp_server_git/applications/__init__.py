"""Applications module for MCP Git Server.

This module contains complete application implementations that represent the highest
level of the system hierarchy. Applications orchestrate all lower-level components
to deliver complete, deployable solutions.

Architecture:
    Applications represent the fifth level in the 5-level hierarchy:
    Level 5: Pages (Applications) - Complete implementations
    - Entry points and main application logic
    - Full workflows and system orchestration
    - Complete deployable solutions

Key components:
    server_application: Main MCP Git Server application
    cli_application: Command-line interface application
    test_application: Testing and validation application

Application characteristics:
    - Complete solutions: Applications provide full end-to-end functionality
    - Entry points: Applications serve as system entry points
    - Orchestration: Applications coordinate all system components
    - Configuration driven: Applications use comprehensive configuration
    - Production ready: Applications include production concerns (logging, monitoring)

System integration:
    - Process management: Applications handle process lifecycle
    - Signal handling: Graceful shutdown and resource cleanup
    - Environment integration: Applications adapt to deployment environment
    - External systems: Applications integrate with external dependencies
    - User interfaces: Applications provide user interaction mechanisms

Production concerns:
    - Logging: Comprehensive structured logging
    - Metrics: Application-level metrics and monitoring
    - Health checks: Application health and readiness endpoints
    - Security: Application-level security and authentication
    - Performance: Application-level performance optimization

Deployment patterns:
    - Container ready: Applications support containerized deployment
    - Configuration external: Applications use external configuration
    - Secrets management: Applications handle secrets securely
    - Scaling: Applications support horizontal scaling
    - Monitoring: Applications integrate with monitoring systems

Example usage:
    >>> from mcp_server_git.applications import server_application
    >>> from mcp_server_git.configuration import ApplicationConfig
    >>>
    >>> config = ApplicationConfig.from_environment()
    >>> app = server_application.MCPGitServerApplication(config)
    >>>
    >>> # Start the application
    >>> await app.start()
    >>>
    >>> # Application is now running and handling requests
    >>> # Will continue until shutdown signal received

Command line usage:
    ```bash
    # Start the MCP Git Server
    python -m mcp_server_git.applications.server_application

    # Use CLI tools
    python -m mcp_server_git.applications.cli_application --help

    # Run tests
    python -m mcp_server_git.applications.test_application
    ```
