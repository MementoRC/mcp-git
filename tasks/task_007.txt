# Task ID: 7
# Title: Decompose server.py - Core Server Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Extract core server logic from the monolithic server.py file into a focused server_core.py module with clear responsibilities.
# Details:
Create `server_core.py` in the frameworks directory with approximately 400 lines focused on core server functionality. Extract server initialization, main event loop, and core request processing logic. Ensure the module follows single responsibility principle and has comprehensive documentation. Use the new type system, constants, and configuration models. Implement the DebuggableComponent protocol for state inspection.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests that verify core server functionality works correctly in isolation. Mock dependencies to test different scenarios including normal operation, error conditions, and edge cases. Verify that the module correctly implements the DebuggableComponent protocol.
