# Task ID: 8
# Title: Decompose server.py - Request Handlers
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Extract request handlers from the monolithic server.py file into a focused server_handlers.py module with clear responsibilities.
# Details:
Create `server_handlers.py` in the frameworks directory with approximately 350 lines focused on request handling and routing. Extract all HTTP/API endpoint handlers and routing logic. Organize handlers by functionality and ensure each handler is well-documented with clear input/output specifications. Use the new type system, constants, and configuration models. Implement the DebuggableComponent protocol for state inspection.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each handler function, testing normal operation, error conditions, and edge cases. Mock dependencies to isolate handler logic. Verify correct routing behavior and response formatting. Test that handlers properly implement validation and error handling.
