# Task ID: 12
# Title: Decompose server.py - GitHub Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extract GitHub integration logic from the monolithic server.py file into a focused server_github.py module with clear responsibilities.
# Details:
Create `server_github.py` in the services directory with approximately 300 lines focused on GitHub integration. Extract GitHub API calls, webhook handling, and authentication. Implement a GitHubService class that encapsulates GitHub interactions. Use the new type system, constants, and configuration models. Implement the DebuggableComponent protocol for state inspection.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for GitHub API interactions, mocking the actual API calls. Test webhook handling with sample payloads. Verify authentication and error handling work correctly. Test rate limiting and retry logic.
