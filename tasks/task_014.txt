# Task ID: 14
# Title: Decompose server.py - Metrics and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Extract metrics and monitoring logic from the monolithic server.py file into a focused server_metrics.py module with clear responsibilities.
# Details:
Create `server_metrics.py` in the services directory with approximately 250 lines focused on metrics collection and monitoring. Extract performance tracking, usage statistics, and health monitoring. Implement a MetricsService class that manages metrics collection and reporting. Use the new type system, constants, and configuration models. Implement the DebuggableComponent protocol for state inspection.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for metrics collection and reporting. Verify that metrics are correctly captured, aggregated, and formatted. Test with various load patterns to ensure accuracy. Verify that monitoring correctly detects and reports system health issues.
