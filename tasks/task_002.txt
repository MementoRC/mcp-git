# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Domain-Specific Type System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive type definitions in the types/ directory including domain-specific type aliases, TypedDict definitions, and Literal types as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Create the following files in the types directory:
- `__init__.py`: Export all types
- `git_types.py`: Git-specific types (RepoPath, GitCommitHash, etc.)
- `github_types.py`: GitHub-specific types (GitHubToken, PRNumber, etc.)
- `session_types.py`: Session-related types (SessionId, UserId, etc.)
- `mcp_types.py`: MCP server-specific types

Implement all type aliases using `NewType`, complex types using `TypedDict`, and status enums using `Literal` as shown in section 4.3.1 of the PRD. Ensure all types are properly documented with docstrings explaining their purpose and usage patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests that verify type checking works correctly with mypy. Include test cases that demonstrate proper type narrowing and validation. Verify that all types can be imported correctly from their respective modules.
