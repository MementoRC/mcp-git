# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Constants Organization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Extract all constants into an organized hierarchy with logical grouping in the constants/ directory as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Create the following files in the constants directory:
- `__init__.py`: Export all constants
- `git_constants.py`: Git-related constants (GitOperationDefaults, GitTimeouts, etc.)
- `github_constants.py`: GitHub-related constants (GitHubAPIDefaults, GitHubRateLimits, etc.)
- `server_constants.py`: Server-related constants (ServerDefaults, ServerLimits, etc.)
- `validation_constants.py`: Validation-related constants

Implement constant classes as shown in section 4.5.1 of the PRD. Use `Final` type annotation for all constants. Add comprehensive documentation for each constant explaining its purpose, valid ranges, and usage context.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests that verify constants are properly defined and cannot be modified at runtime. Test that all constants can be imported correctly from their respective modules.
