# Task ID: 13
# Title: Decompose server.py - Git Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Extract Git operation logic from the monolithic server.py file into a focused server_git.py module with clear responsibilities.
# Details:
Create `server_git.py` in the services directory with approximately 350 lines focused on Git operations. Extract repository management, commit handling, branch operations, and other Git functionality. Implement a GitService class that encapsulates Git operations. Use the new type system, constants, and configuration models. Implement the DebuggableComponent protocol for state inspection.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for Git operations, using test repositories. Test commit, branch, merge, and other operations. Verify error handling and recovery. Test with various repository states including clean, dirty, and conflicted.
