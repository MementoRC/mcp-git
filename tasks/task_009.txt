# Task ID: 9
# Title: Decompose server.py - Middleware Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extract middleware and interceptors from the monolithic server.py file into a focused server_middleware.py module with clear responsibilities.
# Details:
Create `server_middleware.py` in the frameworks directory with approximately 300 lines focused on request/response middleware. Extract authentication, logging, error handling, and other cross-cutting concerns. Implement middleware as composable functions or classes with clear entry and exit points. Use the new type system, constants, and configuration models. Implement the DebuggableComponent protocol for state inspection.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each middleware component, testing normal operation, error conditions, and edge cases. Verify middleware composition works correctly with different ordering. Test that middleware properly handles exceptions and maintains correct request/response flow.
