# Task ID: 11
# Title: Decompose server.py - Tool Registration and Execution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extract tool registration and execution logic from the monolithic server.py file into a focused server_tools.py module with clear responsibilities.
# Details:
Create `server_tools.py` in the frameworks directory with approximately 400 lines focused on tool management. Extract tool registration, validation, execution, and result handling. Implement a ToolRegistry class that manages available tools and their execution context. Use the new type system, constants, and configuration models. Implement the DebuggableComponent protocol for state inspection.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for tool registration, validation, and execution. Test with mock tools to verify correct behavior in different scenarios. Verify that tool execution properly handles success, failure, and timeout conditions.
