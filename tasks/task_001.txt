# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create Project Structure and Repository Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the initial project structure with the hierarchical organization as specified in the PRD, including the 5-level structure and enhanced module structure.
# Details:
Create the following directory structure:

```
src/mcp_server_git/
├── primitives/
├── operations/
├── services/
├── frameworks/
├── applications/
├── types/
├── constants/
├── protocols/
├── debugging/
└── configuration/
```

Ensure each directory has an `__init__.py` file to make it a proper Python package. Set up a proper `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` file for the project with appropriate dependencies. Initialize Git repository with proper `.gitignore` file to exclude common Python artifacts.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the directory structure is created correctly by running a script that checks for the existence of all required directories and files. Ensure the package can be installed in development mode with `pip install -e .`
