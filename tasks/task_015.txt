# Task ID: 15
# Title: Decompose server.py - Security and Validation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Extract security and validation logic from the monolithic server.py file into a focused server_security.py module with clear responsibilities.
# Details:
Create `server_security.py` in the frameworks directory with approximately 300 lines focused on security and validation. Extract authentication, authorization, input validation, and security policy enforcement. Implement a SecurityFramework class that manages security concerns. Use the new type system, constants, and configuration models. Implement the DebuggableComponent protocol for state inspection.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for security validation, authentication, and authorization. Test with various security contexts including valid, invalid, and edge cases. Verify that security policies are correctly enforced and that security violations are properly detected and reported.
