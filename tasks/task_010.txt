# Task ID: 10
# Title: Decompose server.py - Session Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extract session management logic from the monolithic server.py file into a focused server_session.py module with clear responsibilities.
# Details:
Create `server_session.py` in the services directory with approximately 350 lines focused on session management. Extract session creation, validation, expiration, and state management. Implement a SessionService class that manages the lifecycle of sessions. Use the new type system, constants, and configuration models. Implement the DebuggableComponent protocol for state inspection.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for session lifecycle management, including creation, validation, expiration, and cleanup. Test session persistence and recovery. Verify that session state is properly maintained and isolated between different sessions.
