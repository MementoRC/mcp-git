#### Fix the CI workflow issue where tests and linting fail because the CI is not using the dev environment. Looking at the logs:  
####   
#### 1. Tests fail with "No module named pytest" because CI uses default environment instead of dev environment  
#### 2. Linting fails with "ruff: command not found" because ruff is only in dev environment  
####   
#### Current issues in .github/workflows/ci.yml:  
#### - Line 50: `pixi run lint` should be `pixi run -e dev lint`    
#### - Line 103: `pixi run python -m pytest` should be `pixi run -e dev python -m pytest`  
#### - All other CI commands should also use the dev environment  
####   
#### The dev environment contains all the test and quality tools (pytest, ruff, pre-commit, etc.) while the default environment only has runtime dependencies.  
####   
#### Fix all pixi commands in the CI workflow to use the dev environment.
